 > In the first Pirates Of Caribbean movie,the first scene  that Jack  appeared was very impressive for me . It was the music "he is a priate" , I was very excited.Standing atop the yardom of  a small fish dory named Holly Mon,capitan Jack Sparrow  surveyed the town of the Port Roral.His triconered hat sat jauntily atop his head,revealing serveal of red bandanna beneath. when he smiled  , the sun glint off his serveval  gold teeth, on almost every one of his fingers flashed   a  ring , and bits of  silver  and other  trinkets hung from  his brown  ,drealocked hair.

wow ,so hansome ,right? At the same  time  the small fish boat was full of  water , nearly to drowned. It was so funny.


Jack had  a compass. It was a magic compass, not only did it can indicate directs , the most fasinating thing is that it can pointed out  what's people want most.if  the owner of the compass had no target or he couln't think out what he wanted or he wanted too much,the needle  would always being spinning.Where is the compass from,we still  can't figure out .There are different  poins about the origin of the compass. But it played an imporant role  in  the adventure  of seas. 

I do want to have a compass like it. So that  I  can get to there where i want ,and find peopel who I love.

Jack Sparrow  set  a code of  behavior for the pirates. For example  everyone has equal right for daily events(事件，) ，but they should obey the capitan's order .
gambling  is  prohibtened on ships;and so on.


For me ,Jack Sparrow was a lendency,
he seemed to defy that rule with great regularity.
He had been left for dead more times than he could remember.
He had been stranded(搁浅，滞留) on deserted islands,sentenced to eternity in Davy Jone's locker,and sucked beneath the surface of the ocean by the bloodthirsty Kranken.
Each time he was doomed ,with no chance of  survival.
yet ,somehow  ,he always managed to return to the living with stories of great adventure.
