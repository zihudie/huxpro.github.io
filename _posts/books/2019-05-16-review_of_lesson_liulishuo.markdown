There are two kinds of  sports injuries.One is  trauma the other is inflammation.

Sports injuries  are injuries that happen to  atheles paticipating in sporting events.In many cases these injuries are caused by overuse  of  one part of our body.For example runner's knee is painful ==associated with== running,  while tennis elbow is a form of  repetive stress injury at  the elbow. Other type of injuries such as  broken bone ,can be caused by hard contact with something.

Sports injuries can be classifed as either traumatic or overuse injuries.Traumatic injuries account for most injuries in contact sports,such as scoccer,rugby and American football.This is of course due to the dynamic and high collision nature of these games.These injuries range from bruise and muscle strains to fractures and head injuries.

A bruise is  damage to small blood vessels which  causes bleeding wihtin  tissues.A muscle strain  is a small tear of muscle fibers and a ligament sprain is a small tear of ligament tissue.

initial five-day period (最开始的5天)
inflammation

 typically last for 5 days

Inflammtion is characted by pain,  localized swelling , heat ,redness and  a loss of function. However ,too much of the inflammatory response mean that the recovery of process will  take longer,and a return to  activity is delayed. sports injury  treatments are intended to minimize that inflammatory phase of an injury so that the overall healing process is accelerated.




## dependency ratio

The dependency ratio is a relationship between the number of people not  in the labor force and those number in the labor force.


Those not in the labor force are the dependent part of the population.Those in the labor force are productive part of the population.A hight dependency ration means that there are fewer people working to support health,security and education servers which are used by the dependent parts of the population.

This number is caculated by adding the total number of children and the old person ,and diving that number by the nunmber of working aging population.


The dependency ratio is represented into two parts. 

One part focus on the ratio between the children and the working age population.
The other is focuse on the ration between the old and the working age population.Note  that the ratio ingnores the fact that those counted into the ederly segment of the population aren't necessarily dependent.
An increasing poportion  of them are working and many of those in the working age segment  may not be working.
So it is very important to kown how the number is caculated.
(so this way of caculating the  dependecy ratio in a country  can be  misleading.)

By pointing this out ,we can see the danger of using such   a number to make policy without understanding how  ti is caculated.
Therefor  details are very important.




## aging population

The world's population is growing at a rate of little more than 1% per year.However  not all the segments of the population increase at the same rate.
The graph shows  the rate of three differnt groups:children,the ederly and the adults.
As you can see , while the population of the children is fairly constant , ~~( the growth of the elderly  is rising.)~~the elderly population is increasing at the fastest rate.

This is because the very low birth rate in developed countires and the birthrate declines in (most) devloping countries.As a result of this tends  the world's population is aging.

Between 2015 and 2050 ,the percentage of world's population over 60 is expected to be  nearly double. In 2015 there were 900 millions people over 60 and in 2050 the number should be around 2 billions.

Aging populations are  growing  as a great problem  in many countries ,especially  in devloping countries.

It used to be that many elderly people  lived with their family and take care for the next generation.They had a place to stay and  take care for them when they need  assitance.
Now however many elderly people or senior citizens  are left on their own.

This is probably the result of the massive urbanization.

Young and middle-aged  people left their home in the rural areas for ecnomic opportunities  which are only   avalible   in large urban centers.As a result , there is no one to care for the elderly people who are  left behind  to live on their own.

With the aging population  health problems are becoming a growing concern.

Some of the leading conditions that  accompany aging including vision problems,hearing loss,  diabetes and 阿尔兹海默症

These problems can lead to disabilites ,they can make it difficult to live withou assistances.Word wide more than 46% people over 60 and over have  disabilites.

Getting meals ande health care  for example becomes  both expensive and diffcult.


##  living conditions

Living conditions around the world vary from country to country. Some countries have a large number of economies ,but the majority of its citizens are poor. Other countires have smller  economies,but the majority of its citizens are not poor.So the size of a countrie's   economy  isn't the only factor  that determines how  wealthy its citizens are.

The number of a country's  populaion is also an important factor.
One factor that how a country's wealth is distributed is also an important factor.

Let's look some  examples. This chart shows the world's five largest ecnomy in 2015.It ranks countries by the gross domestic product or GDP;
The GDP is one way of mesuaring the size of a country's economy.It is the total value  of  goods and services produced in a country in a year.

According to the chart India had the third largest economy in the world.Its economy was bigger than  Japen's;

However its average living conditions were much higher than India.

One reason for this , because  the differece in population.

India has a much larger population,so its wealth  is distributed  among a large number of people.You can find this information  by checking a country's GDP pecapita.
Pecapita means per person.

If two countries have the same GDP,but one have the half number of population  ,its percapita is twice as large.

## Prepare for an interview

Sam is going to  have an interview. It  is a Japanese medical company ,it has a small office in HK. It wants  to expand its  business in China. This morning Sam got a message from it, Sam was interested in  learning more about the company and he replied to their message and sat up an interview. Even if it doesn't work out it will be a learning experience  for him.

In planning for the interview,Sam has made some notes about what to do at an interview.First  he need to be well prepared ,he needs to know as much as he can about the company,including its history.He also needs to know how to present himself ,including his appereance and body language,it has been years since he was last interviewed.so he needs to be prepare to answer some question about himself. 

For example ,he needs to be able to explain  what is on his resume,including his working experience.(stregth skills)

In any interview situation, it is important to look right and  behavor appropriately.
 He doesn't want to give a bad impression .
 
 Such as he should be careful not to talk too much.
That means he should stay focus and keep his comments short.
Throughout the interview he should observe  thier facial expressions and make eye contact.

it is going to be important  to listen carefully to what they say  and keep things  relaxed as possible.

He needs to remind himselft that  he is alse interviewing them.

He may found that  the company isn't right for him. Therefor he should  be ready to ask them questions espcially about the  expecations. In an interview like this  ,both sides have the same concern. They don't want to make wrong choices.
